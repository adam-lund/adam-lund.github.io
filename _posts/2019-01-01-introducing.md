Welcome to my Github page. Here I collect and link to beta and final versions of software and manuscript that I've produced. My work is focused on statistics, in particularly computational statistics with a lean towards high dimensional and machine learning themes.

From time to time I might  post something about something that I've enjoyed thinking about. 

Enjoy!

Adam
