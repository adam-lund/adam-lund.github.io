Welcome to my Github page. Here I collect and link to beta and final versions of software and manuscript that I've produced. My work is focused on statistics, particularly computational statistics with a lean towards high dimensional and machine learning themes, so basically statistical learning.

Without committing to deeply to this blog, on special occasions I will possibly post something about something that I've enjoyed thinking about.

Enjoy!

Adam
